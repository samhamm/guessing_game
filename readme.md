Beer Geek Guessing Game

I LOVE BEER

Welcome to the 'Beer Geek Guessing Game'.

## How it works ##
The game asks 5 questions to test the geeks knowledge of popular breweries.
Upon opening, the game will prompt users with a question and test their answer to see if it is correct.
If correct, users will see an alert notifying them that they are correct. If incorrect, the correct answer will be shown.
At the end of the game, the final score out of 5 will be shown to the user.

## Answers ##
Users answers are converted to uppercase to ensure that both upper and lowercase answers will be accepted as correct. Users can place in a one word response or the breweries full name. Both answers will be correct. Ex: "stone" and "stone brewing" will both be read as correct respones.
